# SQL_Projects
Project1 - In this project, I learned and successfully performed Data Cleaning on the data using SQL.
         - 1. First , I removed any duplictes in the data.
         - 2. I standardized the data after the removal of duplicates.
         - 3. Worked on any Null or Blank Values, and the decision to either populate them or let them remain unchanged.
         - 4. Finally, removed any unnecessary columns that were not required.



Project2 - After completing the first project, I used the same Dataset to perform EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis). I did perform the EDA successfully by implementing my knowledge of SQL using various queries to find anything interesting from it.
